# CS & Stuff Code, Notes, and Scripts
A place where I keep notes.code,and scripts(and possibly more) for YouTube videos [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp2HrtejRkWuf1h_TJ4LHcA].

# Organization
- Each video will gets its own folder in the main branch.
 - Each sub-folder in this video folder will have files associated with that video and the sub-folder name will denote the role of the files in the production of the video.
 
# Pull Requests
- Feel free to create pull requests if you find errors. Thank you!
